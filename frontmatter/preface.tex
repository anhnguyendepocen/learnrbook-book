``Suppose that you want to teach the `cat' concept to a very young child. Do you explain that a cat is a relatively small, primarily carnivorous mammal with retractible claws, a distinctive sonic output, etc.? I'll bet not. You probably show the kid a lot of different cats, saying `kitty' each time, until it gets the idea. To put it more generally, generalizations are best made by abstraction from experience.''

% Such pauses are not a miss use of our time. To learn a natural language we need to interact with other speakers, we need feedback. In the case of R, we can get feedback both from the outcomes from our utterances to the computer, and from other R users.}

\vspace{2ex}This book covers different aspects of the use of \Rpgrm. It is meant to be used as a tutorial complementing a reference book about \R, or the documentation that accompanies R and the many packages used in the examples. Explanations are rather short and terse, so as to encourage the development of a routine of exploration. This is not an arbitrary decision, this is the normal \emph{modus operandi} of most of us who use R regularly for a variety of different problems.

I do not discuss here statistics, just \Rpgrm as a tool and language for data manipulation and display. The idea is for you to learn the \Rpgrm language like children learn a language: they work-out what the rules are, simply by listening to people speak and trying to utter what they want to tell their parents. Instead of listening, you will read and execute on a computer \Rlang code statements, try your hand at telling \Rlang what you want it to compute. I do provide explanations and comments, but the idea of these book is mainly for you to use the numerous examples to find-out by yourself the overall patterns and coding philosophy behind the \Rlang language. Instead of parents being the sound board for your first utterances in \langname{R}, the computer will play this role. You will \emph{play} by modifying the examples, see how the computer responds, does \Rlang understand you or not?

When teaching I tend to lean towards challenging students rather than telling a simplified story. I do the same here, because it is what I prefer as a student, and how I learn best myself. Not everybody learns best with the same approach, for me the most limiting factor is for what I listen to, or read, to be in a way or another challenging or entertaining enough to keep my thoughts focused. This I achieve best when making an effort to understand the contents or to follow the thread or plot of a story. So, be warned, reading this book will be about exploring a new world, this book aims to be a travel guide, neither a traveler's account, nor a cookbook of R recipes.

Keep in mind that it is impossible to remember everything about \Rpgrm! \Rpgrm in a broad sense is vast because its capabilities can be expanded with independently developed packages. Learning to use \Rlang consists in learning the basics plus developing the skill of finding your way in \Rlang and its documentation.  In 2017 the number packages available for free in the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) broke the 10\,000 barrier. CRAN is the most important, but not only, public repository for R packages. How good a command of the \Rlang language and packages a user needs depends on the type activities to be carried out. This book attempts to train you in the use of the \Rlang language itself and some packages that provide extensions for data manipulation and graphical display which are broadly useful. Given the availability of numerous books on statistical analysis with \Rlang, here we will cover only the bare minimum. The same is true for package development in \Rlang. This book seats in-between, aiming at teaching programming in-the-small: the use \Rlang to automate the drudgery of data manipulation from raw data, through data exploration to the production of publication quality illustrations.

As with all ``rich'' languages there are many different ways of doing things in R, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution to a problem. There is always a compromise involved, usually between time spent by the user and processing time required in the computer. Many of the packages that are most popular nowadays did not exist when I started using R, and many of these packages make new approaches available. One could write many different \Rlang books with a given aim and still use substantially different ways of achieving the same results. In this book, I limit myself to packages that are currently popular and/or that I consider elegantly designed. I have in particular tried to limit myself to packages with similar design philosophies, especially in relation to their interfaces. What is elegant design, and in particular what is a friendly user interface depends strongly on each user's preferences and previous experience. Consequently, the contents of the book are strongly biased by my own preferences. I have tried to write examples in ways that execute fast without compromising readability. I encourage readers to take this book as a travel guide, as a starting point for exploring the very many packages, styles and approaches which I have not described.

I will appreciate suggestions for further examples, notification of errors and unclear sections. Many of the examples here have been collected from diverse sources over many years and because of this not all sources are acknowledged. If you recognize any example as yours or someone else's please let me know so that I can add a proper acknowledgement. I warmly thank the students that over the years have asked the questions and posed the problems that have helped me write this text and correct the mistakes and voids of previous versions. I have also received help on on-line forums and in person from numerous people, learnt from archived e-mail list messages, blog posts, books, articles, tutorials, webinars, and by struggling to solve some new problems on my own. In many ways this text owes much more to people who are not authors than to myself. However, as I am the one who has written this version and decided what to include and exclude, as author, I take full responsibility for any errors and inaccuracies.

I have been using \Rpgrm since around 1998 or 1999, but I am still constantly learning new things about \Rpgrm itself and \Rpgrm packages. With time it has replaced in my work as a researcher and teacher several other pieces of software: \pgrmname{SPSS}, \pgrmname{Systat}, \pgrmname{Origin}, \pgrmname{Excel}, and it has become a central piece of the tool set I use for producing lecture slides, notes, books and even web pages. This is to say that it is the most useful piece of software and programming language I have ever learnt to use. Of course, in time it will be replaced by something better, but at the moment it is the ``hot'' thing to learn for anybody with a need to analyse and display data.

\textbf{Icons used to mark different content.} Throughout the book text boxes marked with icons present different types of information. First of all, we have \emph{playground} boxes indicated with \playicon\ which contain open-ended exercises---ideas and pieces of R code to play with at the R console. A few of these will require more time to grasp, and are indicated with \advplayicon. Boxes providing general information, usually not directly related to \langname{R} as a language, are indicated with \infoicon. Some boxes highlighted with \ilAttention\ give important bits of information that must be remembered when using \langname{R}---i.e.\ explain some unusual feature of the language. Finally, some boxes indicated by \ilAdvanced\ give in depth explanations, that may require you to spend time thinking, which en general can be skipped on first reading, but to which you should return at a later, and peaceful, time with a cup of coffee or tea.

%\textbf{Status as of 2016-11-23.} I have updated the manuscript to track package updates since the previous version uploaded six months ago, and added several examples of the new functionality added to packages \ggpmisc, \ggrepel, and \ggplot. I have written new sections on packages \viridis, \pkgname{gganimate}, \pkgname{ggstance}, \pkgname{ggbiplot}, \pkgname{ggforce}, \pkgname{ggtern} and \pkgname{ggalt}. Some of these sections are to be expanded, and additional sections are planned for other recently released packages.
%
%With respect to the chapter \textit{Storing and manipulating data with R} I have put it on hold, except for the introduction, until I can see a soon to be published book covering the same subject. Hadley Wickham has named the set of tools developed by him and his collaborators as \textit{tidyverse} to be described in the book titled \textit{R for Data Science} by Grolemund and Wickham (O'Reilly).
%
%An important update to \ggplot was released last week, and it includes changes to the behavior of some existing functions, specially faceting has become extensible through other packages. Several of the new facilities are described in the updated text and code included in this book and this pdf has been generated with up-to-date version of \ggplot and packages as available today from CRAN, except for \pkgname{ggtern} which was downloaded from Bitbucket minutes ago.
%
%The present update adds about 100 pages to the previous versions. I expect to upload a new update to this manuscript in one or two months time.
%
%\textbf{Status as of 2017-01-17.} Added ``playground'' exercises to the chapter describing \ggplot, and converted some of the examples earlier part of the main text into these playground items. Added icons to help readers quickly distinguish playground sections (\textcolor{blue}{\noticestd{"0055}}), information sections (\textcolor{blue}{\modpicts{"003D}}), warnings about things one needs to be specially aware of (\colorbox{yellow}{\typicons{"E136}}) and boxes with more advanced content that may require longer time/more effort to grasp (\typicons{"E04E}). Added to the sections \code{scales} and examples in the \ggplot chapter details about the use of colors in R and \ggplot2. Removed some redundant examples, and updated the section on \code{plotmath}. Added terms to the alphabetical index. Increased line-spacing to avoid uneven spacing with inline code bits.
%
%\textbf{Status as of 2017-02-09.} Wrote section on ggplot2 themes, and on using system- and Google fonts in ggpplots with the help of package \pkgname{showtext}.

%
%\textbf{Status as of 2017-04-08.} Completed writing first draft of chapter on data, writing all the previously missing sections on the ``grammar of data manipulation''. Wrote two extended examples in the same chapter. Add table listing several extensions to \pkgname{ggplot2} not described in the book.
%
%\textbf{Status as of 2017-04-13.} Revised all chapters correcting some spelling mistakes, adding some explanatory text and indexing all functions and operators used. Thoroughly revised the Introduction chapter and the Preface. Expanded section on bar plots (now bar and column plots). Revised section on tile plots. Expanded section on factors in chapter 2, adding examples of reordering of factor labels, and making clearer the difference between the labels of the levels and the levels themselves.
%
%\textbf{Status as of 2017-04-29.} Tested with R 3.4.0. Package \pkgname{gganimate} needs to be installed from Github as the updated version is not yet in CRAN. Function \code{gg\_animate()} has been renamed \code{gganimate().}
