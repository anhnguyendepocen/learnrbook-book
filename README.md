### What is this repository for? ###

This repository contains some draft chapters of what will some time become a book 
titled _Learning R... as you learnt your mother tongue_. 
Some of these chapters started as teaching notes and others as appendixes to a 
handbook. However, they grew too big to be appendixes. 

### Just clone the repository ###

To build the pdf you will need XeLaTeX and the KOMA script classes, and R and 
knitr. At the moment the files are in Rnw format but may at some point be 
reformatted using Bookdown or Rmarkdown.

### Contribution guidelines ###
