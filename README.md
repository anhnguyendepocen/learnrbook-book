### What is this repository for? ###

This repository contains some draft chapters of what will some time become a book titled . These chapters started some as teaching notes and others as appendixes to a handbook. However, they grew to big to be appendixes. 

### Just clone the repository ###

To build the pdf you will need LaTeX and the KOMA script classes, and R and knitr. At the moment the files are in Rnw format but will at some point be reformatted using Bookdown or Rmarkdown.
